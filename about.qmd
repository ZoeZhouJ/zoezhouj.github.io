:::{#hero-heading}
Hi there! I'm **Zoe Zhou**, my Chinese name 周佳瑞 is pronounced as "Jo jar-ray". I'm a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. 

This site is a reflection of my passions. Here, you’ll find:

- Projects where I unravel patterns and tell stories hidden in data.
- A Photography Gallery filled with snapshots of natural beauty and candid moments.
- Insights into my journey, aspirations, and maybe even a few experiments (both in data and life).

I’m on a mission to merge the power of data with the beauty of nature, finding stories in numbers and moments in the wild. 

Whether you’re here for inspiration, collaboration, or simply to wander, I’m excited to have you along for the ride.

# Background
I graduated from the University of Washington in 2016 with Bachelor of Science degrees in Economics and Earth Science, a combination that shaped my approach to tackling environmental inequities as a sustainable development project officer.

Over the years, I've led coastal conservation projects on Hainan Island, China, leveraging technical expertise and community-driven solutions—deploying drones for ecological assessments and collaborating with organizations like UNDP, WWF, and the International Climate Initiative to drive impactful environmental initiatives.

Specializing in Conservation Planning at the Bren School, I'm developing expertise in environmental modeling and data visualization to support restoration interventions that enhance climate resilience.

# A little bit more..
Beyond research, I find balance and inspiration through surfing and hiking. Living and working on islands has shown me firsthand how communities depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods, culture, and protection. These experiences have shaped my passion for coral reef restoration, particularly understanding how reefs are connected and how restoration can build resilience in the face of mounting climate challenges.
