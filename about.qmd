#### This site is a reflection of my passions—a space where science meets creativity. Here, you’ll find:

#### - Projects where I unravel patterns and tell stories hidden in data.
#### - A Photography Gallery filled with snapshots of natural beauty and candid moments.
#### - Insights into my journey, aspirations, and maybe even a few experiments (both in data and life).

#### Whether you’re here for inspiration, collaboration, or simply to wander, I’m excited to have you along for the ride.
