Hi there! I'm **Zoe Zhou**, my Chinese name 周佳瑞 is pronounced as "Jo jar-ray". I'm a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB. 

This site is a reflection of my passions. Here, you’ll find:

- Projects where I unravel patterns and tell stories hidden in data.
- A Photography Gallery filled with snapshots of natural beauty and candid moments.
- Insights into my journey, aspirations, and maybe even a few experiments (both in data and life).

I’m on a mission to merge the power of data with the beauty of nature, finding stories in numbers and moments in the wild. 

Whether you’re here for inspiration, collaboration, or simply to wander, I’m excited to have you along for the ride.

# Background
I graduated from the University of Washington in 2016 with Bachelor of Science degrees in Economics and Earth Science, a combination that shaped my approach to tackling environmental inequities as a sustainable development project officer.

Over the years, I’ve led coastal conservation projects on the Island of Hainan, China, where I combined technical expertise with community-driven solutions. From deploying drones for ecological assessments to navigating grant processes with organizations like UNDP, WWF, and the International Climate Initiative, I’ve honed the ability to balance technical proficiency with local insights. My work has consistently centered on integrating sustainable practices to address ecological and community needs.

Currently, I’m pursuing a specialization in Conservation Planning at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I’m focused on sharpening my skills in ecosystem services modeling and restoration planning to design strategies that promote sustainable development and help communities build resilience against climate challenges.

# Research 
Living and working on islands, including Hainan, China, has shown me firsthand how communities depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods, culture, and protection. These experiences have shaped my passion for coral reef restoration, particularly understanding how reefs are connected and how restoration can build resilience in the face of mounting climate challenges.

My research focuses on coral connectivity modeling, where I explore how coral larvae travel across ocean currents to settle and grow. Using oceanographic data and larval dispersal models, I work to map the invisible highways that connect coral populations. This knowledge is essential for identifying priority areas for restoration—places where efforts will have the greatest impact not just locally, but across entire reef systems. By understanding these connections, we can better design networks of restored reefs that are more resilient and self-sustaining over time.

# For Fun
Outside of my research, I find balance and inspiration through surfing at sunrise or sunset and hiking in the mountains. Being immersed in nature, whether on the waves or a trail, reminds me why I’m passionate about protecting these incredible ecosystems.
