## About
Saw palmetto (*Serenoa repens*) and scrub palmetto (*Sabal etonia*) are both keystone species in south-central Florida that support the pine flatwoods ecosystem. This analysis uses logistic regression to classify these two native palmetto species based on plant characteristics. The goal is to evaluate whether variables such as plant height, canopy dimensions, and the number of green leaves can effectively predict species classification. The highlight of this study includes data visualization, logistic regression modeling, and models assessment with cross-validation. 

### Data Summary

**Palmetto Monitoring Data**
The dataset used for this analysis can be accessed through [EDS Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.317.1). It provides detailed measurements of the growth and survival characteristics of Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia, two prominent palmetto species in Florida. The specific variables included in the dataset are:

### Analysis Outline
1. Data Exploration
2. Train Logistic Regression Models
3. K-fold Cross-Validation 
4. Model Assessment
5. Predict with Best Performaing Model
6. Test Classification Accuracy 

## Set-up
We will use the following libraries and set-up through this analysis
```{r}
# Import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(here)
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(stats)
library(yardstick)

```

## Data Exploration 
From the metadata, code 1 represents Serenoa repens, code 2 represents Sabal etonia. We will first load the dataset and preprocess the data by selecting the relevant columns and removing missing values, then factorize the string type species column into dummy variables: 0 for Serenoa repens and 1 for Sabal etonia.
```{r}
# Load the dataset
df <- read_csv(here("posts","2025-02-18-plant-classifier","data", "palmetto.csv"))
# Preprocess data
df_clean <- df %>% 
  select(species, height, length, width, green_lvs) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(species = factor(species, levels = c('1','2'), labels = c(0, 1)))
kable(head(df_clean), title = "Palmetto Data cleaned")
```

### Histograms

Both species exhibit overlapping distributions for height, width, and length, indicating these variables alone may not perfectly distinguish between Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia.

- Height (Figure 1): The height distribution of Sabal etonia is slightly higher than that of Serenoa repens.

- Width (Figure 2): Sabal etonia shows a slightly higher peak in the middle range (100–120 cm) compared to Serenoa repens.

- Length (Figure 3): Significant overlap exists, but Sabal etonia tends to grow longer (100–200 cm), while Serenoa repens is more concentrated in shorter lengths (<200 cm).

- Green Leaves (Figure 4): Serenoa repens generally has more green leaves than Sabal etonia, highlighting a potential growth pattern difference.

### Paired Scatter Plots
We will create paired scatter plots to visualize the relationship between plant characteristics. The scatter plots show the relationship between green leaves and width (Figure 5) and height and canopy length (Figure 6). The plots are colored by species to highlight differences in growth patterns. The scatter plot of green leaves vs. width (Top) shows less overlap compared to the height vs. canopy length plot (Bottom), indicating that green leaves and width may be more useful for species classification. However, all variables exhibit some degree of overlap, emphasizing the need for a combination of predictors to improve classification accuracy.
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 5 & 6: Scatter Plots of Paired Plant Characterstics"
# leaves vs. width
p1 <- ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = width, y = green_lvs, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(

    x = "Width (cm)",
    y = "Number of Green Leaves",
    color = "Species"
  ) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("0" = "#964B00", "1" = "skyblue"),
                    labels = c("Serenoa repens", "Sabal etonia")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_minimal()

# Height vs. Length
p2 <- ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = height, y = length, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Height vs. Canopy Length by Species",
    x = "Height (cm)",
    y = "Max Canopy Length (cm)",
    color = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("0" = "#964B00", "1" = "skyblue"),
                    labels = c("Serenoa repens", "Sabal etonia")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  theme_minimal() 
  
p1/p2
```
### Correlation Heat Map

Then, we will use a heatmap to visualize the pairwise correlations among all numeric variables in the palmetto dataset. The heatmap suggests that `height`, `length`, `canopy`, `biomss` and `width` are highly positively correlated, which can be explained by larger plants having larger dimensions and more biomass. The variable `species` shows a negatively correlation with `green_lvs`, `new_lvs` and `biomass`, with the strength of correlation descending in that order. 

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 7: Pairwise Correlation Heatmap of Palmetto Data"
# try a heatmap
# Select numeric columns for correlation analysis
numeric_features <- df[sapply(df, is.numeric)]
numeric_features <- numeric_features[, !(colnames(numeric_features) %in% c("year", "site", "survival","plant"))]
# Compute the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_features, use = "complete.obs")

# Convert the correlation matrix to a long format for ggplot2
cor_data <- as.data.frame(as.table(cor_matrix))

# Create the heatmap
ggplot(cor_data, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +  # Add gridlines
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "lightblue", high = "salmon", mid = "white", midpoint = 0, 
                       limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab", name = "Correlation") +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap of Palmetto Data", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```
## Train Logistic Regression Models
### Data Split 
We will split the data into training and testing sets using a 70/30 split and check for class imbalance. 
```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Split the data
df_split <- initial_split(df_clean, prop = 0.7, strata = species)
df_train <- training(df_split)
df_test <- testing(df_split)

# Check class imbalance
train_class <- df_train %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) 

test_class <- df_test %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) 
```

### Model Training 

Set engine

```{r}
# initiate model 
log <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

**Model 1**: log odds of species based on height, length, width and leaves as predictor variables.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
# Create recipe
rec_1 <- recipe(species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs, data = df_train) 

# Fit model with training data
log_1 <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec_1) %>%
  add_model(log) 

log_1_fit <- log_1 %>%
  fit(data = df_train)
```

**Model 2**: log odds of species based on height, width and green leaves as predictor variables.
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
rec_2 <- recipe(species ~ height + width + green_lvs, data = df_train) 

log_2 <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec_2) %>%
  add_model(log) 
log_2_fit <- log_2 %>%
  fit(data = df_train)
```

### Compare models using K-fold Cross-Validation
Randomly divide training data into k groups, 
train models with k-1 folds, leaving one out for validation. Compute performance metrics for k number of models. 
Average k test errors to get an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. 

**Model 1**
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
# Split training data 
folds <- vfold_cv(df_train, v = 10, strata = species)

# Fit models with 9 folds and evaluate on the remaining fold
log_1_folds <- log_1 %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds)

# Calculate model performance
m1_metrics <- collect_metrics(log_1_folds)
```

**Model 2**
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
log_2_folds <- log_2 %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds)

m2_metrics <- collect_metrics(log_2_folds)
```

Model Comparison
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Model Comparison"
# Display tables 
condensed_table <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Model 1", "Model 2"),
  Accuracy_Mean = c(m1_metrics$mean[1], m2_metrics$mean[1]),
  ROC_AUC_Mean = c(m1_metrics$mean[3], m2_metrics$mean[3])
)
kable(condensed_table, title="Model Comparison")
```
From 10 fold cross-validation, Model 1 has a higher accuracy and ROC AUC compared to Model 2, suggesting that model 1 is better at classification. 

## Train Best Model
```{r}
# Finalize the model using entire data set
log_1_final <- log_1 %>%
  last_fit(split = df_split)

# Extract actual models
model_final <- log_1_final %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip() 
  
model_table <- model_final %>%
  tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    term = case_when(
      term == "height" ~ "Maximum Height",
      term == "length" ~ "Maximum Canopy Length",
      term == "width" ~ "Maximum Canopy Width",
      term == "green_lvs" ~ "Count of Green Leaves",
      TRUE ~ term
    ),
    p.value = ifelse(as.numeric(p.value) < 0.01,'<0.01', as.character(p.value))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(p.value = as.character(p.value)) %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Logistic Regression Model Results") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
model_table
```
Each coefficient estimate shows how much the likelihood of the outcome being species Sabal etonia changes when the corresponding predictor increases by one unit. 

## Classification Results
This section evaluates how successfully the selected model would classify a plant as the correct species. I use a confusion matrix and histogram of predicted probabilities to assess the model's performance. 

### Predict with Model
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| result: "hide"
#| include: false
result <- df_test %>%
  mutate(predict(model_final, new_data = df_test, type="class")) %>% 
  mutate(predict(model_final, new_data = df_test, type = "prob")) 

result %>%
  select(species, .pred_class, .pred_0, .pred_1) 

# Calculate TP, FP, TN, FN
TP <- sum(result$species == 1 & result$.pred_class == 1)  # True Positives
FP <- sum(result$species == 0 & result$.pred_class == 1)  # False Positives
TN <- sum(result$species == 0 & result$.pred_class == 0)  # True Negatives
FN <- sum(result$species == 1 & result$.pred_class == 0)  # False Negatives

summary_table <- tibble(
  species = c('Serenoa repens','Sabal etonia'),
  correctly_classified = c(TN, TP),
  incorrectly_classified = c(FN, FP),
  percent_correct = scales::percent(round(
    c(TN / (TN + FN), TP / (TP + FP)), 2
    )) 
)
```

```{r}
# Display the final table
kable(summary_table, caption = "Model Classification Results")
```

### Visualize Results with Confusion Matrix
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 8: Confusion Matrix Heatmap"
# Make confusion matrix with true/false positive and true/false negative
conf_matrix <- result %>%
  conf_mat(truth = species, estimate = .pred_class)

cm <- autoplot(conf_matrix, type = "heatmap") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "salmon", high = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Confusion Matrix Heatmap",
    x = "Predicted Species",
    y = "Actual Species"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Serenoa repens", "Sabal etonia")) +  # Custom labels for x-axis
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("Sabal etonia","Serenoa repens")) +  # Custom labels for y-axis
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none" 
  )
cm
```

### Visualize Results with Predicted Probability
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 9: Density Plot of Predicted Probabilities"
# Pivot result table for plotting
result_long <- result %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(.pred_0, .pred_1), names_to = "plant", values_to = "probability")

# Plot predicted probabilities
prob_p <- ggplot(result, aes(x=.pred_1, fill = as.factor(species)))+
  geom_density(stat ='density',position="identity",alpha=0.7)+
  labs(title="Density Plot of Predicted Probabilities",
       x="Predicted Probability of Sabal etonia",
       y="Frequency",
       fill="Species")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "#964B00", "1" = "skyblue"),
                    labels = c("Serenoa repens", "Sabal etonia"))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "right" 
  )

```
### Discussion

This study utilizes plant height (in cm), canopy length (in cm), canopy width (in cm), and the count of green leaves to develop a regression model aimed at predicting two closely related plant species. The results indicate promising accuracy, achieving 91.7% for Serenoa repens and 91.13% for Sabal etonia. The model's sensitivity is calculated as 91.83%, indicating its ability to correctly identify positive cases, while its specificity is 91.01%, reflecting its accuracy in identifying negative cases.
